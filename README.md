# PromptLab

A powerful desktop laboratory for crafting code-based prompts for LLMs.
Allows users to quickly inject their code and craft a prompt with parseable xml format response.
Works best with reasoning models.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This is an experimental project and may have compatibility issues on some operating systems. Provided "as is" without any warranties.

## Installation

### Linux
Download the latest `.AppImage` or `.deb` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/0xIbra/promptlab/releases).

#### AppImage
```bash
chmod +x PromptLab-*.AppImage
./PromptLab-*.AppImage
```

#### Debian/Ubuntu
```bash
sudo dpkg -i promptlab_*.deb
```

### Windows
Download and run the latest `.exe` installer from the [releases page](https://github.com/0xIbra/promptlab/releases).

### macOS
Download and install the latest `.dmg` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/0xIbra/promptlab/releases).

#### Note for macOS Users
Since the app is not notarized with Apple, you'll need to follow these steps to run it:

1. After downloading the `.dmg` file, double-click to mount it
2. Drag the PromptLab app to your Applications folder
3. Open Terminal and run the following command:
```bash
xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/PromptLab.app"
```

> **Why is this necessary?**
> macOS adds a quarantine attribute to applications downloaded from the internet as a security measure. Since PromptLab is not notarized with Apple (which requires an Apple Developer account), we need to manually remove this attribute. This command essentially tells macOS that you trust this application.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Only run this command for applications you trust and have downloaded from a reliable source.**

After running the command, you can open PromptLab normally from your Applications folder. This process only needs to be done once after installation.

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xIbra/promptlab.git
cd promptlab
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Building
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Create distributable
npm run dist
```

### Creating Releases

1. Update version in `package.json`
2. Create and push a new tag:
```bash
git tag v0.1.1
git push origin v0.1.1
```

This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow that:
- Builds the app for Linux, Windows, and macOS
- Creates a new GitHub release
- Uploads all build artifacts to the release
